## Day 4
This week I am the PIC for Resignees and I'm responsible for collecting items from resignees such as badges, assets, accessories, hard drives, software, etc. During my PIC week, there were a total of 8 resignees, including one of my coworkers, Ang Yee Ken, who is a senior intern and taught us a lot.

Upon arrival of the resignees, I would check the resignees' belongings against the MIS lists to ensure that they had returned the correct items and then I would instruct them to acknowledge out the items. I would ask them to clock in the last time and return it to me.

I would then need to save the returned items in the resignee locker.

After keeping the items, I would record the resignee's details in a Google Sheet. Finally, I need to delete the resigner's employee information and the resigner's rfid record.
