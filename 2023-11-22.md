# Log Book Short (20 Nov - 26 Nov 2023)

After my lunch break, I went to the data center room on the second floor where all the assets, accessories, partitions, packing boxes, etc. that will be scrapped in the future are stored. The store's PICs and I were responsible for organizing all the end-of-life monitors into boxes. First, we need to separate the different models of monitors. Then, we will disassemble the monitors and stands. Finally, we needed to box them up and get them ready for shipment out to scrap.
