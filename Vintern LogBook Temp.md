## Day 1
After my lunch break, I went to the data center room on the second floor where all the assets, accessories, partitions, packing boxes, etc. that will be scrapped in the future are stored. The store's PICs and I were responsible for organizing all the end-of-life monitors into boxes. First, we need to separate the different models of monitors. Then, we will disassemble the monitors and stands. Finally, we needed to box them up and get them ready for shipment out to scrap.

## Day 4
This week I am the PIC for Resignees and I'm responsible for collecting items from resignees such as badges, assets, accessories, hard drives, software, etc. During my PIC week, there were a total of 8 resignees, including one of my coworkers, Ang Yee Ken, who is a senior intern and taught us a lot.

Upon arrival of the resignees, I would check the resignees' belongings against the MIS lists to ensure that they had returned the correct items and then I would instruct them to acknowledge out the items. I would ask them to clock in the last time and return it to me.

I would then need to save the returned items in the resignee locker.

After keeping the items, I would record the resignee's details in a Google Sheet. Finally, I need to delete the resigner's employee information and the resigner's rfid record.
